Files saved by the preprocessing library functions are as follows.
Filenames are configurable; the ones shown are typical.


Global metadata:

"dataset-meta.mat" contains:
  sessionlist  (struct array per SESSIONMETA.txt)
  ttldefs  (per TTLSIGNALDEFS.txt)
  probelabels  (from getAllProbeNames({ sessionlist.probedefs }))
  probetitles  (from getAllProbeNames({ sessionlist.probedefs }))



Per-session metadata that we don't have to revisit:

"(session)-events-raw.mat" contains everything returned by readAllTTLEvents(),
without time alignment or timestamp propagation:
  boxevents
  gameevents
  evcodedefs  (per EVCODEDEFS.txt)
  gamereftime  (time subtracted from all game timestamps)
  deveventsraw
  deveventscooked
  devnames  (structure with human-readable dev names indexed by dev label)


"(session)-framedata-raw.mat" contains the data table returned by
readRawFrameData(), without time alignment or timestamp propagation:
  gameframedata  (data table)


"(session)-gazedata-raw.mat" contains the data table returned by
readRawGazeData(), without time alignment or timestamp propagation:
  gamegazedata  (data table)


"(session)-align.mat" contains the tables returned by alignAllDevices():
  timetables  (structure with several tables containing timestamp tuples)


Note that the event tables and gaze/frame data tables will have to have
timestamps propagated via a call to propagateAlignedTimestamps().

Note that "deveventscooked" may need to be augmented with the canon list of
events from "boxevents" by calling augmentEphysEvents().



Per-session metadata that we do want to revisit:

"(session)-chanmap.mat" contains:
  chanlabels_raw  (Field Trip channel labels)
  chanlabels_cooked  (channel labels as used in the experiment analysis)


Note that Charlie's convention is to keep the FT channel labels as-is but
to sort channels in the FT structure based on the cooked labels.


"(session)-trialmeta.mat" contains:
  codesbytrial  (cell array with per-trial event code tables)
  metabytrial  (struct array returned by getTrialMetadataFromCodes())
  trialdefs  (Field Trip trial definition matrix plus metadata columns)
  trialdeftable  (table with "trialdefs" info, plus column names)
  trial_align_evcode  (event code name used for time zero in trials)
  trialindices  ("trial index" from the trial definition table)
  triallabels  (filename-safe trial index labels)
  trialnames  (human-readable plot-safe trial index names)
  sessionlabel  (a copy of the filename-safe session label)
  sessiontitle  (a copy of the human-readable plot-safe session name)


Note that the tables in "codesbytrial" are agumented and have timestamps
propagated from other devices.

Trial definitions were produced by getTrialDefsWide(), which is intended to
segment entire trials aligned to some common event. Subsequent analyses can
extract smaller time windows aligned to other features within these large
segments.



Per-probe data:

"(session)-(probe)-badinfo.mat" contains:
  ftlabels_raw  (a copy of ftdata_XXX.label)
  ftlabels_cooked  (cooked channel labels corresponding to ftlabels_raw)
  triallabels  (filename-safe trial labels, from "trial index")
  trialnames  (human-readable plot-safe trial names, from "trial index")
  badchandata (a structure with per-algorithm analysis output structures):
    log  (raw hand-annotated good and bad channels)
      good  (cell array with raw labels for hand-annotated good channels)
      bad  (cell array with raw labels for hand-annotated bad channels)
    force
      bad  (raw list of channels to store in "badraw", ignoring methods)
    spect  (spectral analysis for bad channel evaluation)
      freqedges  (frequency band edges)
      bandpower  (nChans x nBands x ntrials in-band power)
      tonepower  (nChans x nBands x nTrials log10(max / median) power in-band)

"(session)-(probe)-badlist.mat" contains:
  badchanmeta (a structure with the following fields:)
    goodraw  (raw FT channel labels of hand-annotated good channels)
    badraw  (raw FT channel labels of any-method bad channels)
    goodcooked  (cooked channel labels of hand-annotated good channels)
    badcooked  (cooked channel labels of any-method bad channels)
    ftlabels_raw  (raw channel labels in data order)
    ftlabels_cooked  (cooked channel labels in data order)
    goodrawbymethod (structure with per-algorithm raw good channel labels):
      log  (raw hand-annotated good channels)
    badrawbymethod (structure with per-algorithm raw bad channel labels):
      log  (raw hand-annotated bad channels)
      force  (raw list of channels to store in "badraw", ignoring methods)
      spect  (raw bad channel labels from spectral analysis)

"(session)-(probe)-(label)-ephys.mat" contains:
  ftdata  (ft_datatype_raw structure with event-aligned cropped ephys data)
  ftlabels_cooked  (cooked channel labels corresponding to ftdata.label)

"(session)-(probe)-(label)-meta.mat" contains:
  "sessionmeta"  (a single session metadata structure, per SESSIONMETA.txt)
  "probemeta"  (a probe definition structure, per PROBEDEFS.txt)
  "ftlabels_raw"  (raw FT labels in data order, with bad channels removed)
  "ftlabels_cooked"  (cooked FT labels in data order, with bad chans removed)
  "oldtrialmeta"  (structure with variables from "(session)-trialmeta.mat")
  "trialmask"  (boolean vector indicating which old trials were kept)
  "trial_maskedfromorig"  (vector with new trial indices, indexed by old)
  "trial_origfrommasked"  (vector with old trial indices, indexed by new)
  "newtrialmeta"  (copy of "oldtrialmeta" with some trials removed, and
     without "trial_align_evcode", "trialdefs", and "trialdeftable")



Per-trial data:

"(session)-(probe)-(trial)-ephysXXX.mat" contains:
  ftdata_XXX  (ft_datatype_raw structure with trial ephys data)
  ftlabels_cooked  (cooked channel labels corresponding to ftdata_XXX.label)

XXX values are:
  raw  (unprocessed ephys data)
  clean  (ephys data after artifact rejection and notch filtering)
  wb  (ephys data after re-referencing; reference is from non-bad channels)
  lfp  (low-pass-filtered ephys data; Local Field Potential)
  hp  (high-pass-filtered ephys data, for extracting spike shapes)
  mua  (band-pass/rectified/low-pass ephys data; Multi-Unit Activity)

Note that channels in ftdata_XXX have been sorted in cooked order, despite
keeping the raw names.
