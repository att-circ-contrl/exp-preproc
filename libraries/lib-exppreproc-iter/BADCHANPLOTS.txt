Configuration for plotting bad channel data is specified by a structure with
the following fields:

"spect" is a configuration structure for plotting spectral band detection
  data. If this field is absent, no plots are generated.



Configuration structures for spectral band detection plots have the following
fields:

"plot_only_average" is true to suppress per-trial plots and false otherwise.
"plots_wanted" is a cell array with zero or more of the following:
  'powerbychan' plots in-band power vs channel for each band.
  'tonebychan' plots relative tone power vs channel for each band.
  'powerheatmap' plots in-band power vs channel and band, normalized across
    channels.
  'toneheatmap' plots relative tone power vs channel and band, normalized
    across channels.
  'powerheatband' plots in-band power vs channel and band, normalized across
    bands.
  'toneheatband' plots relative tone power vs channel and band, normalized
    across bands.
