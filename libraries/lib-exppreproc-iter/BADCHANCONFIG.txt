Iteration functions can perform bad channel detection by several methods.

The methods desired and their configuration parameters are specified by a
configuration structure with the following fields:

"log" is a structure with configuration for hand-annotated channel lists.
"force" is a structure with configuration for forced channel list overrides.
"spect" is a structure with configuration for spectral band analysis.



Bad channel detection via hand-annotated channel lists reads lists of good
and bad channels that were annotated in log files that use Louie's format.

Configuration structures for hand-annotated bad channel parsing have the
following fields:

"annotated_are_cooked" is true if channel names are cooked (i.e. translated
  using the channel map), and false if channel names are raw (i.e. the
  labels listed in ft_datatype_raw structures).



Bad channel list overrides replace the final bad channel list with a user-
-supplied list, per epIter_afterFunc_badInfoAll().

Configuration structures for user-specified bad channel lists have the
following fields:

"annotated_are_cooked" is true if channel names are cooked (i.e. translated
  using the channel map), and false if channel names are raw (i.e. the
  labels listed in ft_datatype_raw structures).



Bad channel detection via spectral band analysis measures power in several
frequency bands and looks for channels that are anomalous compared to other
channels.

Configuration structures for spectral band analysis have the following
fields (per nlProc_getBandPower and euHLev_guessBadChansFromBandPower):

"freqedges" is a vector with the edge frequencies of the bands to test.
"bandrange" is the range of in-band power values to accept, in standard
  deviations.
"tonerange" is the range of (log-scale) relative tone power values to
  accept, in standard deviations.
