The following types of function handle are used by epIter_processSessions.
Passing NaN instead of a function handle skips that function (so there's
no need to define do-nothing functions).



beforedata = probefuncbefore( sessionmeta, probemeta, trialdefmeta, wantmsgs )

This function is called during probe iteration, before trial iteration. It
is intended to gather session- or probe-specific data needed when processing
trials.

"sessionmeta" is a single session metadata structure, per SESSIONMETA.txt.
"probemeta" is a probe definition structure, per PROBEDEFS.txt.
"trialdefmeta" is a structure containing all of the variables in the trial
  definition metadata file, per PREPROCFILES.txt.
"wantmsgs" is true to emit console messages and false otherwise.

"beforedata" is a return variable of any type (typically a struct).



trialresult = ...
  trialfunc( sessionmeta, probemeta, trialdefmeta, tidx, beforedata, wantmsgs )

This function is called during trial iteration. It is intended to do two
things: First, it may read per-trial input files and generate per-trial
output files. Second, it may generate per-trial output data that is
aggregated for analysis (or just recording) by "probefuncafter".

"sessionmeta" is a single session metadata structure, per SESSIONMETA.txt.
"probemeta" is a probe definition structure, per PROBEDEFS.txt.
"trialdefmeta" is a structure containing all of the variables in the trial
  definition metadata file, per PREPROCFILES.txt.
"tidx" is the row index of the present trial within trial metadata tables.
"beforedata" is the data variable returned by "probefuncbefore".
"wantmsgs" is true to emit console messages and false otherwise.

"trialresult" is a return variable of any type (typically NaN if unused,
  and either a struct or a scalar if used).



probefuncafter( ...
  sessionmeta, probemeta, trialdefmeta, beforedata, trialresults, wantmsgs )

This function is called during probe iteration, after trial iteration. It
is intended to consolidate per-trial return data and to write either this
consolidated data or some derived analysis output to disk.

"sessionmeta" is a single session metadata structure, per SESSIONMETA.txt.
"probemeta" is a probe definition structure, per PROBEDEFS.txt.
"trialdefmeta" is a structure containing all of the variables in the trial
  definition metadata file, per PREPROCFILES.txt.
"beforedata" is the data variable returned by "probefuncbefore".
"trialresults" is a cell array indexed by trial row number that contains
  the data variables returned by "trialfunc".
"wantmsgs" is true to emit console messages and false otherwise.

No return value.
